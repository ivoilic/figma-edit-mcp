# Project Instructions

## Code Style

- Use TypeScript for all new files
- Avoid default exports except where required
- Use arrow functions when possible
- Adhere to the prettier rules
- Use the `~/*` alias to import when possible
- Don't use `any` in TypeScript
- Leave comments in US English

## Development
- Always run `pnpm typecheck` when making big changes to confirm nothing is broken
